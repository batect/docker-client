# Dummy SSH keys

This directory contains dummy keys used to test forwarding an SSH agent to a BuildKit image build.

They are not used (and should never be used) for any other purpose given they are available in plain text to anyone with access to this repository.

If you need to recreate them, run [`./regenerate.sh`](regenerate.sh).
