# Dummy client certificates

This directory contains dummy certificates used to test creating a client for a daemon that communicates over TLS.

They are not used (and should never be used) for any other purpose given they are available in plain text to anyone with access to this repository.

If you need to recreate them, run [`./regenerate.sh`](regenerate.sh).
